# What is Linear_Regression
Linear regression is a statistical model that examines the linear relationship between two: <br>
Simple Linear Regression or Multiple Linear Regression variables <br>
It models the relationship between a dependent variable and onr or more independent variables. <br>
# Directions 
1. Plot the data with y as the output and x as the input And Plot <br>

2. Fit a linear regression model to this data. <br>

3. Predict the value for y when x is 27. <br>
[28.31612] <br>
4. Predict the value for y when x is 150. <br>
[175.0592] <br>
5. Would you want to use this regession model for predicting y when x is 150? Why ore why not? <br>
NO, 150 is not enough data. <br>
Linear regression needs a lot of training data so that it can fit the data correctly, <br>
avoiding under-fitting as well as over-fitting
