# What is Linear_Regression
Linear regression is a statistical model that examines the linear relationship between two:
Simple Linear Regression or Multiple Linear Regression variables
It models the relationship between a dependent variable and onr or more independent variables. 
# Directions 
1. Plot the data with y as the output and x as the input And Plot

2. Fit a linear regression model to this data.

3. Predict the value for y when x is 27.
[28.31612]
4. Predict the value for y when x is 150.
[175.0592]
5. Would you want to use this regession model for predicting y when x is 150? Why ore why not?
NO, 150 is not enough data.
Linear regression needs a lot of training data so that it can fit the data correctly, avoind under-fitting as well as over-fitting
