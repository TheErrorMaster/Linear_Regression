# What is Linear Regression
Linear regression is a statistical model that inspects the linear relationships
between a (y) dependent variable and one or more (x1,x2,xN) independent variables.
Predictive Analysis two things, Predicts variable do a good job in predicting a dependent  
variable and which variable in particular are significant predictors of the outcome variable? <br>
# Formula 
The Simpliest form of the regression equation is y = a + b*x <br>
y = dependent variable <br>
x = independet varaible <br>
b = regression cofefficient <br>
a = constant

# Directions 
1. Plot the data with y as the output and x as the input And Plot <br>

2. Fit a linear regression model to this data. <br>

3. Predict the value for y when x is 10. <br>

4. Predict the value for y when x is 20. <br>
[19.96] <br>
5. Would you want to use this regession model, when it only has N = 97 dependents or number of data length?
Why ore why not? <br>
NO, 97 is not enough data. <br>
Linear regression needs a lot of training data so that it can fit the data correctly, <br>
avoiding under-fitting as well as over-fitting
