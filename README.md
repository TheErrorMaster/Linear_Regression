# What is Linear_Regression

Linear regression is a statistical model that examines the linear relationship: <br>
Simple Linear Regression or Multiple Linear Regression variables <br>
It models the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. <br>
It is commonly used for predictive analysis. <br>
Examines two things: <br>
1. Does a predictor variable do a good job in predicting an outcome(dependent)variable. <br>
2. Which variable in particular are significant predictors of the outcome variable? <br>
# Formula 
The Simpliest form of the regression equation is y = a + b*x <br>
y = dependent variable <br>
x = independet varaible <br>
b = regression cofefficient <br>
a = constant

# Directions 
1. Plot the data with y as the output and x as the input And Plot <br>

2. Fit a linear regression model to this data. <br>

3. Predict the value for y when x is 27. <br>
[28.31612] <br>
4. Predict the value for y when x is 150. <br>
[175.0592] <br>
5. Would you want to use this regession model for predicting y when x is 150? Why ore why not? <br>
NO, 150 is not enough data. <br>
Linear regression needs a lot of training data so that it can fit the data correctly, <br>
avoiding under-fitting as well as over-fitting
